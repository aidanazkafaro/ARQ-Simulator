# ARQ Simulation Program
This is a Python program that can simulate three ARQ methods: Stop-and-Wait, Go-Back-N, and Selective Repeat. The program was created by Aidan Azkafaro, Kemas Rafly Omar Thoriq, and Melchior Natthan V H F H.

## Getting Started
To use this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website: [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can download the program from the GitHub repository: [Github](https://github.com/aidanazkafaro/ARQ-Simulator)

## Running the Program
To run the program, open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the directory where the program is saved. Then, enter the following command:

```py
python arq_simulation.py
```
This will start the program and display the main menu.

## ARQ Methods
The program can simulate three ARQ methods:

```
Stop-and-Wait
Go-Back-N
Selective Repeat
```
Each method has its own menu, where you can set the parameters for the simulation, such as the number of packets to send and the probability of a packet being lost or corrupted.
